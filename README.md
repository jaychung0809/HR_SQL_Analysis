# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
 
## There are 32,859 employees ready for retirement (born between 1952 and 1955, still employed)

# Since there are going to be 32,859 open positions that is also the number of individuals being hired.

## There are 1549 employees that are eligible to be mentors (currently employed born in the year 1965)

### Recomendation: Focus more mentorship programs on the departments with the highest "ready-for-retirement" employees, as those departments will see the biggest impact after retirement.
